# BO3-Liquid-Divinium-Logic-Monitor
A Black Ops 3 zombies mod that displays, in real-time, the results of in-game probability calculations used to determine Liquid Divinium drops.

This mod doesn't change how the game functions in any way, it just displays the outcomes of each test that the game runs to determine when to award the player with Liquid Divinium. 

I made this for the purpose of supporting my explanation of how Liquid Divinium drops are actually determined, since the community still doesn't seem to fully understand how it works, and even the [Call of Duty Wiki](https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Liquid_Divinium) currently states that:  

*"the exact algorithm which is used to determine a Divinium drop is still somewhat of a mystery"*

If you want to learn more about how the game actually makes the decisions, I broke it down into Pseudo code on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1ncxtuq/liquid_divinium_earning_logic/).

## Instructions
If you just want to inject the mod, you can download the **compiled.gsic** file above and follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MepTbdJlmU&t=256) from 04:16 onwards (you can skip everything before that).

If you want to compile the mod yourself, and/or tweak the mod's code, you can follow the first 03:40 of [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7MepTbdJlmU) on how to set up the compiler. 

## Video
You can see the mod in action on the video below.
