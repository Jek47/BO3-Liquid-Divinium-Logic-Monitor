# BO3-Liquid-Divinium-Logic-Monitor
Displays in real-time the results of in-game probability calculations used to determine Liquid Divinium drops.

This mod doesn't change how the game functions in any way, it just displays the outcomes of each Test that the game runs to determine when to award the player with Liquid Divinium. 
I made this for the purpose of supporting my explanation of how Liquid Divinium drops are actually determined, since the Call of Duty Wiki currently states that: 
*the exact algorithm which is used to determine a Divinium drop is still somewhat of a mystery"

If you want to learn more about how the game actually makes the decisions, I broke it down into Pseudo code on [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CODZombies/comments/1ncxtuq/liquid_divinium_earning_logic/).
